# **SomuLove Project**

## **Project Overview**
The **SomuLove Project** is a fun, interactive web application that demonstrates creativity and programming concepts through a playful interaction. It features a user interface where a user is asked a delightful question, *"Do you Love me?"*, and responds with buttons for "Yes" and "No." The "Yes" button displays randomized heartfelt messages, while the "No" button humorously moves away when hovered over, making it impossible to click.

## **Features**
1. **Interactive Buttons**:
   - Clicking "Yes" displays a randomized, sweet message from a pre-defined list.
   - Hovering over the "No" button triggers it to move to a random position, adding humor and fun to the experience.

   - The displayed messages change on each click, and the app ensures the same message isnâ€™t repeated after a refresh.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - The interface adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on desktop and mobile.

4. **Playful Visuals**:
   - Includes an engaging image and visually appealing buttons styled with CSS transitions.
